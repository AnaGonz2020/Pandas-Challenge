# Analysis

Using the two datasets provided, students_complete.csv and schools_complete.csv, I have completed a few calculations, and have come up with the final conclusion- Charter schools have the higher scoring students. With larger classes in District Schools, there is not enough resources to support students, whereas Charters (up to 2000), with their smaller classes, teachers are able to provide a more in depth experience and environment.
