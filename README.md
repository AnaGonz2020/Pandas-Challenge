# Results
    Although it took me longer than the anticipated timeframe to complete, I am so excited to share my results with you. The code generated goes through the provided CSV files, and retrieves the requested data utilizing functions to call these actions. In the formatting of my dataframes, I was unable to master the decimal positioning, but I formatted them as best as I could.

# Comments and Thoughts
    As scared and intimidated as I was coming in to the Pandas Module, I am happy with the experience this challenge gave me. Throughout my time working on this challenge, I rode the emotional roller coaster of 'do I know what I am doing?', 'should I continue this?'. With not just the support at home, but all the help the Instructor and TA provide and the additional support on Slack, I was able to push through it. I have been fortunate enough to have met some awesome classmates, who, without a doubt, helped me so much in completing this challenge when I hit a KeyError that stumped many a people. With the Study Group we created, I have been able to hear other's experience and how they are doing. 

    I became more confortable creating dataframes within files, while working on this challenge. I had difficulty understanding some of the KeyErrors and ValueErrors that kept popping up, but with the BugFixingBonanza material from class, I became a little more familiar with debuigging and searching for the solutions to the errors that kept coming up. I definitely learned that I am in dyer need of more practice on the Syntax of things. My mind is stuck on the 'there is only one right answer' way I have been using my entire life, so rewiring that aspect has definitely had an impact on how fast I can move forward. With time and lots of studying, this will be a breeze.
